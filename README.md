<h1>RPG++</h1>
RPG++ is a little project i'm working on to teach me the basics of making top down RPGs in SDL with Visual C++.<br><br>
I'm fairly new to game development with my only prior game dev project being retro Snake in pygame (Python-In-Python repo on my github). That being said i'm obviously no expert and alot of how i implement the code will probably not be the best. Either way though, if you find something amongst the code you think is cool or you want to use it in your project PLEASE DO!<br><br>
If you do end up using the code, crediting me in the project would be lovely! But of course not mandatory. If you know anything that would help me make my code better please do inform me as i will not be accepting any contributions.
